# geo_LD_viz_v2
---------------

This is a project exploring geographic variation in LD-patterns across the
populations of the 1000 Genomes Project. 


## Environment Setup

TODO : detail steps to setup the environment via conda

## Analyses Steps

### 1. Low-Resolution Representation of LD Matrices

* Description of the K x P matrices
* Binning method for 8-bit storage
* Superpopulation vs population

### 2. Fast Computation of Statistics on Low-Resolution Representation


### 3. Plotting Statistics on a Geographic Map

* Develop plotting function via cartopy for single plots
